<h3 align=center> CLI for create README.md </h3>

<br>
<br>

<h2>👀 Comments</h2> 
<p>This CLI was made in a Linux environment (Zorin OS 16 Lite), from what I found in a Windows environment the CLI has problems working.

I don't know if this affects all Windows environments, as I've only tested it on one PC, but even so those who can contribute would be of great help</p>

<h2> ⭐ Objectives of this repository / project: </h2>
<p>This project aims to make my life a little easier when creating READMEs.md, I always prefer to use a pattern, without changing too much from project to project, so I decided to create a CLI for whenever I need to type just one command in the terminal and that generate me a README.md the way I want or with a good base of it already ready, perfect to be something fast and agile</p>
